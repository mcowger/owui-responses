        recent messages, and compare THAT candidate to budget - not the raw
        history size, which never shrinks and would re-trigger this on every turn.

        Only when the candidate still doesn't fit do we fold all of `pending`
        into one new, permanently-frozen summary block. Blocks are generated
        exactly once and never re-summarized, so a long conversation accumulates
        a short, append-only list of summaries instead of repeatedly
        re-summarizing (and degrading) the same content.

        `force=True` folds `pending` immediately regardless of whether the
        candidate fits the budget - used when the user opts to compress early
        via the warning-threshold prompt, ahead of the hard cap.

        NOTE: `blocks` is intentionally left unbounded here - it is never capped
        or merged. For a pathologically long-lived chat (many fold events) this
        list would itself keep growing the token cost of the "blocks" section.
        Deferred for now per explicit decision; revisit with e.g. a
        max-block-count valve that merges the oldest two blocks if this ever
        becomes a real problem in practice.
