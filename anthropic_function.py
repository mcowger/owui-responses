v0.9.14
- Added Claude Opus 4.8

- Added `ENABLE_CACHE_DIAGNOSTICS` valve for debug purposes

v0.9.12
- Refactored the pipe into modular source files under `src/anthropic_pipe/`.

v0.9.11
- Added async handling for run_command <-> bash tool
- Added all anthropic server tools as TOOL_SEARCH_EXCLUDE_TOOLS
